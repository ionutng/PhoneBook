This was my first project working with Entity Framework. After reading documentation, watching videos, and actively working on this project, I feel that I've gained some understanding of it. Although there are aspects I've learned but haven't applied in this project, I believe this knowledge will prove valuable in future projects. Of course, there are still many aspects of Entity Framework that I have yet to explore and learn.
